## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Dual-Mode Rendering Engine**: Automatically displays a beautiful portfolio homepage on your main domain and detailed, conversion-focused sales pages on your asset domains.
- **Deeply SEO-Optimized**: Built with a "static-first" approach, ensuring all content is perfectly visible to search engine crawlers.
- **Highly Customizable**: Easily define custom titles, logos, images, themes, prices, currencies, and contact info for each individual asset via a central config file.
- **Zero Dependencies & Zero Build Steps**: Written in pure, vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, no `npm install`, no complications. Just edit and deploy.

## üöÄ Deployment with Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

This project is designed to work perfectly with Cloudflare Pages.

1. **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Configure your portfolio:**
   - Edit the `config.js` file in your forked repository. Define your main portfolio in `PORTFOLIO_CONFIG` and add all your assets to `ALL_DOMAIN_CONFIGS`.
   - (Optional) Upload any images to the `assets/img/` directory and reference them in `config.js`.
3. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:**
   - Log in to your Cloudflare dashboard and go to **Workers & Pages**.
   - Click **Create application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
   - Select your forked repository.
   - In the "Build settings", you can leave everything as default. No build command or output directory is needed.
   - Click **Save and Deploy**.
4. **Add Custom Domains:**
   - Once deployed, go to your new Pages project's settings and click on the **Custom domains** tab.
   - Add your main portfolio domain and all your asset domains/subdomains. Cloudflare will guide you through the verification process.

That's it! Your entire portfolio is now live on Cloudflare's global edge network, and any future changes you push to the `main` branch of your repository will trigger an automatic redeployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

All customization happens inside `config.js`. The file is self-documented and allows you to control every aspect of your project.

- `PORTFOLIO_CONFIG`: Defines the content and appearance of your main homepage.
- `ALL_DOMAIN_CONFIGS`: Acts as the database for all your individual assets. Each key is the domain/subdomain that triggers the rendering of a specific page.
